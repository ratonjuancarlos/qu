## Requirements

### Objective

The objective of this challenge is not necessarily just to solve the problem - but to evaluate your software development skills, code quality, creativity, and resourcefulness as a potential future colleague. Please share the necessary artifacts you would provide to your colleagues in a real-world professional setting.

We have a simple API that returns a JSON array. We would like you to use HTML, CSS and Javascript to read the API and display it in an organized way. In addition, you should add in some sort of sorting mechanic to the front-end. Feel free to use any frameworks you would like to achieve the task.

Feel free to use any data - but perhaps you can use the “planet” resource here.

There is no right answer here - just looking for an understanding of how you interpret the assignment and what decisions you make to build a simple project.
